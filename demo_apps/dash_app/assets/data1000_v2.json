The mixture was allowed to reflux for one hour and 45 minutes with magnetic stirring. The cooled mixture was poured into a mixture of ice (2800 g) and 3.5% HCl (2800 ml.) and stirred. A yellow precipitate was collected by filtration, washed first with three portions (600 ml.) of 5% NaOH, second with one portion (600 ml.) of 3.5% HCl, third with three portions (600 ml.) of water, and then dried in vacuo to obtain crude 4,8-dimethylisopsoralen (48.6 g, 87.6% yield, mp. 160\u00b0-174\u00b0 C.).
